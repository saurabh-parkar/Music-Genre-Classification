# Music-Genre-Classification

Due to the enormous growth in the streaming music industry, both the users and the streaming services struggle a lot to manage the music libraries manually. Music genre classiﬁcation is the backbone of various features provided by music streaming applications such as music recommendations, soundtrack recognition, etc. It also streamlines the user experience by allowing users to sort through the music based on their music preference and ﬁnd similar music to the genres they like. A robust and accurate music classiﬁer using various machine learning models can be used to automate the process of tagging unknown music tracks and improve the overall user experience.

In this project, we plan to build models to classify audio clips into 8 music genres using 3 diﬀerent deep learning approaches and other regression models. We will be using features extracted from MFCC and Mel spectrogram as they retain both frequency as well as time information. Using these approaches will help us understand how the frequency and time domain features aﬀect the music classiﬁcation process and also help us compare deep learning models with classical machine learning algorithms.
